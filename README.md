## Features
- üëÅÔ∏è Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- üò¥ Drowsiness alert based on emotions via DeepFace
- üîî Audible alert with buzzer for drowsy states
- üñ•Ô∏è Gender and age detection for monitored faces
- üìä Continuous monitoring through webcam feed
- üö® Alerts for missing faces or drowsy behavior

## Prerequisites

| Requirement   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| üêç Python    | 3.11+ version |
| üì∏ Webcam    | Built-in or external |
| üíæ Disk Space | Minimum 1GB free space |
| üíª RAM       | At least 4GB recommended |

## Installation
Clone the repository and install necessary packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/driver-safety-monitoring.git
cd driver-safety-monitoring
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Launch the monitoring system:

```bash
python driver_monitor.py
```

Press `q` to terminate the program.

Ensure proper lighting and face positioning for optimal results.

    A[Webcam] --> B[Frame Capture];
    B --> C[Gray Conversion];
    C --> D[Face Detection];
    D --> E{Face Found?};
    E -->|Yes| F[Face Emotion Analysis];
    E -->|No| G[Trigger Face Alert];
    F --> H{Drowsy Emotion Detected?};
    H -->|Yes| I[Activate Buzzer];

    L -->|Yes| M[Alert Tilt];
    L -->|No| N[Monitor Continues];
```

## Troubleshooting

### üé• Webcam Not Detected
Check connected video devices:

```bash
ls /dev/video*
```

### üêå Performance Issues
Run the program with lower FPS:

```bash
python driver_monitor.py --fps 15
```

### üîä Sound Alert Not Working
Ensure `winsound` is enabled (Windows-only). For other systems, adapt the code for compatible sound alerts.

## Development Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies using `pip`.
4. Test the program with sample video inputs.

## Testing
- Test the system with live webcam monitoring.
- Validate emotion detection for various facial expressions.
- Simulate drowsy conditions to trigger buzzer alerts.

## FAQ

### üé• Q1: Can recorded videos be used instead of live feed?
**A:** Yes, update the video capture line:

```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("video.mp4")
```

### üí° Q2: How to improve detection accuracy?
**A:** Ensure proper lighting, minimal face obstructions, and higher-resolution webcams.

### üì± Q3: Can the system run on mobile devices?
**A:** Currently, the code is optimized for desktop systems. Mobile support requires additional modifications.
